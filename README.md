# GameOfChance
The idea of the game is for the player to move their token around the board (shown in Figure 1) collecting letters with the aim of forming a five-letter palindrome (eg ‘VGDGV’ or ‘BUKUB’).
Suppose square 2 is not on the edge of the board. We say square 1 is adjacent to square 2 if square 1 can be reached by moving one square up/down/left/right/diagonally from square 2. For example, in Figure 2, the eight squares surrounding the square containing N are all said to be adjacent to the square containing N.
We don’t need to define what an adjacent square means for squares on the edge of the board.
